    "\n",
    "1. Gauss's Law for Electricity:\n",
    "   $$\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E} = \\frac{\\rho}{\\varepsilon_0}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "The FDTD method discretizes space and time using a grid, such as the Yee grid, and updates the electric and magnetic fields at each grid point at discrete time steps. The core FDTD update equations are as follows:\n",

    "For the electric field ($\\mathbf{E}$):\n",

    "The FDTD method approximates the spatial derivatives using finite differences and advances the fields in time, making it well-suited for solving Maxwell's equations numerically. By updating the fields at each grid point over time, FDTD simulations provide a comprehensive and accurate representation of how electromagnetic waves propagate, reflect, and interact with materials and structures in a computational domain. This method is particularly valuable for understanding a wide range of electromagnetic phenomena, from wave propagation to antenna design and photonic device analysis.\n",

# PHY653/PC716: Computational Electromagnetics and Plasma Physics

Instructor: Pakorn Wongwaitayakornkul

## Course Description:
This course offers an in-depth exploration of computational methods in electromagnetics and plasma physics, focusing on solving differential equations, simulating electromagnetic field interactions with charged particles, investigating wave-particle interactions, instabilities, vortex dynamics, and magnetic reconnection. Students will gain hands-on experience through computational labs using Jupyter Python notebooks to implement and solve problems related to the topics discussed in lectures. The course will cover solving Maxwell's equations, simulating particle motions in electromagnetic fields, plasma fluid descriptions, magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium, waves, instabilities, vortex dynamics, and magnetic reconnection.
